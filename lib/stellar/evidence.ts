/**
 * The evidence envelope, enforced by the type system rather than by discipline.
 *
 * The product's whole claim is that a number arrives with its provenance. A
 * convention cannot carry that: `sources?: Source[]` compiles perfectly with
 * nobody having filled it in, and the value renders anyway. So the envelope is
 * a discriminated union whose **resolved branch cannot be constructed without
 * at least one source** — the tuple type `readonly [Source, ...Source[]]` makes
 * an empty array a compile error — and whose unresolved branch **cannot be
 * constructed without a reason**.
 *
 * The consequence is deliberate and slightly inconvenient: reading `.data`
 * requires narrowing first. That inconvenience is the feature. A caller cannot
 * accidentally render an unavailable value as a blank, because there is no
 * `.data` to render until they have acknowledged the state.
 */

/**
 * The five states, as a value.
 *
 * The type alone cannot be rendered, so every surface that wanted to show the
 * vocabulary retyped it — and a retyped vocabulary is how a document ends up
 * naming states the code stopped using, which is the exact drift canon §12 had
 * to repair. The type is derived from this array rather than the other way
 * round, so adding a state to one and forgetting the other is a compile error.

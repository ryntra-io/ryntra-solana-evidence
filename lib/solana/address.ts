/**
 * What a Solana address is, defined once.
 *
 * This rule existed twice in effect and nowhere by name: the transfer schema
 * carried the regex, and every surface that collects an address carried
 * nothing — so a value that could never be an address travelled to the network,
 * was read against the chain, and came back as a schema refusal that named no
 * field. The founder hit exactly that: a recipient beginning `wallet-` produced
 * "The transfer proposal or policy was not accepted."
 *
 * So the shape lives here, with no imports, and the schema consumes it. One
 * definition is the point — this repository has recorded, more than once, that
 * two lists which must agree eventually disagree in silence.
 *
 * Base58 omits `0`, `O`, `I` and `l` deliberately, because those are the four
 * characters people mistake for each other when copying a key by eye.

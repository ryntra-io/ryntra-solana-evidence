/**
 * Deterministic evaluation of an owner's policy over an exact preview.
 *
 * Thirteen rules, each producing one finding; the verdict is an aggregation
 * with a written precedence, not a judgement call:
 *
 *   BLOCKED  >  INCOMPLETE  >  REVIEW_REQUIRED  >  NO_KNOWN_BLOCKER
 *
 * A forbidding rule outranks missing evidence — a transfer that is refused
 * is refused regardless of what else is unknown — and missing evidence
 * outranks a review flag, because "a person should look" presumes there is
 * a complete picture to look at. The bottom of the ladder is deliberately
 * `NO_KNOWN_BLOCKER`, never "safe": this function reports the absence of
 * known blockers, and absence of knowledge is a different thing it reports
 * as INCOMPLETE.

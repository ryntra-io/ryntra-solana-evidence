/**
 * The credit governor's contract — what an adapter needs from the thing that
 * counts credits, and nothing about how it counts them.
 *
 * An adapter reserves the expected cost of a call before it is made and
 * settles on the provider's own answer afterwards; whether the counting
 * lives in a shared database (the product) or in one process (a script, a
 * test, the open example) is the governor's business. `createMemoryGovernor`
 * is the one-process implementation: ceilings, reservations and settlements
 * in a plain object, gone when the process ends — right for a script that
 * reads a handful of figures with its own key, wrong for anything two
 * instances share.

/**
 * The DD.xyz adapter — the second provider behind the evidence layer's one
 * interface, plus the one read a recipient needs: a mint in, a normalized
 * point-in-time snapshot out; an address in, a normalized address read out;
 * every call reserved with the governor before it is made and settled on the
 * provider's own price after.
 *
 * One family answers the token (`trading-lite`, 4 CU); two answer an address
 * (`sanctions`, 1 CU, then `addresses`, 3 CU), each governed on its own, so
 * a ceiling reached between the two yields evidence with the first engine's
 * answer and an honest note on the second, never a refusal of both. The
 * failures are read for what they are: a refused kind of address is
 * *unsupported* (UNKNOWN, never green); a plan gate, a refused key, a rate
 * limit, a provider fault or a timeout is UNAVAILABLE with the reason; a
 * budget the governor refuses is UNAVAILABLE before a socket opens.
 *
 * Nothing above this file knows which provider answered beyond the
 * snapshot's `provider` field; the governor is the same contract the Nansen
 * adapter speaks.

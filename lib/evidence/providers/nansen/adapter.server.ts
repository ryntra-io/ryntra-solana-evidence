/**
 * The Nansen adapter — the provider behind the evidence layer's one
 * interface: a mint and a window in, a normalized read out, every call
 * reserved with the governor before it is made and settled after.
 *
 * Two families answer one snapshot: the token screener filtered to the one
 * mint (the whole-market DEX figures) and flow intelligence (the labelled
 * groups' net movement). Each is one credit and each is governed on its
 * own, so a ceiling reached between the two yields a snapshot with the first
 * family's figures and an honest note on the second, not a refusal of both.
 * A family that fails for a reason a person cannot mend (no key, no
 * credits, a rate limit, a provider fault) is reported as such; the read is
 * UNAVAILABLE only when nothing answered.
 *
 * The next provider implements the same `MarketEvidenceProvider` shape with
 * its own families and its own rights map; nothing above this file knows
 * which provider answered beyond the snapshot's `provider` field. The
 * governor is a contract (`governor.ts`): the product hands the shared
 * ledger, a script hands a one-process counter.

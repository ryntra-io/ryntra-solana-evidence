/**
 * The boundary gate: what this kit structurally cannot do, asserted by reading
 * the shipped sources rather than by trusting a README.
 *
 * Every file the public kit is made of is listed in one manifest, and this
 * test scans exactly that list — so a file added to the kit without being
 * added to the manifest never reaches the public repository, and a file added
 * to the manifest is scanned from its first run. The same test runs in the
 * private repository (against `docs/solana/SDK-EXTRACTION-MANIFEST.json`) and
 * in the generated public one (against its `SOURCE-MANIFEST.json`), so the
 * boundary cannot hold in one tree and fail in the other.

/**
 * Ryntra Solana Evidence Kit — the typed SDK.
 *
 * Three calls, one job each: read what a mint structurally is, preview an
 * exact SPL transfer against a declared policy, and check an Outcome Receipt
 * without asking the party that wrote it. Everything here is read-only by
 * construction — this package builds no transaction, holds no key, and calls
 * no state-changing RPC method. `boundaries.test.mjs` asserts that by reading
 * the shipped sources rather than by trusting this paragraph.
 *
 * The evidence core is imported, not copied. `lib/solana/` is the one
 * implementation the Ryntra product itself runs on, and the public extraction
 * carries those exact files — so a result from this SDK and a result from
 * ryntra.io come from the same code, or the extraction is broken and its
 * tests say so.
